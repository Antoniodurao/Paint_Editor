# Paint Editor ðŸŽ¨
- Welcome to the Paint Editor, a Java application developed as part of the Code For All Academy exercise! 
- This project serves as a canvas to showcase my understanding of various Java concepts, including Inheritance, Encapsulation, and working with Input Mechanics, Input and Output Streams.

## ðŸš€ How it Works
- The Paint Editor provides a simple yet interactive experience with a map grid of 500 by 500 squares. 
- Your selected square acts as a painter, allowing you to color the adjacent squares on the grid. 
- While the concept may seem straightforward, the underlying implementation delves into fundamental Java principles.

## ðŸŽ® Features
1. Movement: Use the following keys to navigate your square on the grid:

- W: Up
- A: Left
- S: Down
- D: Right

2. Change color M: Available Colors:
 
- Black â¬›
- Blue ðŸŒ€
- Red ðŸ”´
- Cyan ðŸ”·
- Green ðŸŸ¢
- Dark Grey ðŸ”²
- Light Grey ðŸŒ‘
- Orange ðŸŸ 

3. Additional Actions:

- U: Undo
- C: Save current grid (undo not possible after saving)
- \: Clear all
- ENTER: Load previous save

## ðŸŒˆ Showcase of Java Skills
This project serves as a comprehensive exercise, demonstrating proficiency in key Java concepts:

- Inheritance: Utilized to structure the application and create a cohesive class hierarchy.
- Encapsulation: Implemented to encapsulate data and behaviors, promoting code organization and maintainability.
- Input Mechanics: Handled keyboard inputs for smooth and intuitive interaction.
- Input & Output Streams: Leveraged to save and load the state of the grid.
